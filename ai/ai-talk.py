Wow, you've just written your first Python codeâ€”congratulations! Now, let's explore variables. Variables are essential in programming; think of them as containers for storing data. In Python, creating a variable is simple. For example, x = "Homebrew is the new Harvard" assigns the text Homebrew is the new Harvard to a variable named x. This means you can use x later in your code to refer to this text. If you're curious about what a piece of Python code does, you can copy it and paste it into the code editor below.""",
